            <p>Web development means creating web pages, web applications, and websites using coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a web designer, diagnosing and fixing problems with websites are also part of the job. Your day-to-day tasks range from developing simple web pages containing plain text to complex web applications, social networking services, and business platforms.</p><br>

                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>A web developer may focus on the back end or server-side of web delivery to ensure that a website functions correctly and efficiently, or on the front end helping to create interactions for users. Possible careers include Front-end Web Developer or Back-end Web Developer.</p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>Web designers craft the overall vision and plan for a website. A web designer's job is less about using code to bring a website to life and more about determining a site's layout, color palette, font set, and visual themes.</p>

                <p>My goal is to be a passionate inspiring and creative developer that will be able to invent and innovate; also share and teach others in a way that they can be excited like I am about programming. Last but not least be a competent freelancer.</p>

            <p>In terms of the skills that they actually need to develop, there are two key things that stand out in my mind. The first one is around  problem solving. It doesn't matter what sphere of work you end up in, problem solving is absolutely crucial,  every stage of that, from actually understanding a problem, interpreting it in a way you can tackle the problem and then going on to actually analyze possible solutions, looking for elegant solutions, efficient solutions, and then evaluating what you've done. That applies almost right across the board, so I think that's one of the things whatever subject youngsters are studying in school, whatever life experiences they have, that has to play a part.</p><br>

            <p>When people ask me what the biggest trend on the web is, I tell them globalization. Web services are being used globally and they are increasingly being built globally. There is no place in the world that has a lock on talent, ideas, and execution. Web development is a global phenomenon.</p><br>
